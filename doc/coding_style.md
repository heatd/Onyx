# Onyx Coding Guidelines
This file will describe the coding guidelines used to get a pull request accepted to the OS
## Indentation
A tab MUST equal 8 spaces (don't come up with any broken indentation, because I won't fix it)
## Operator spacing
The operators in the C source files will always be separated by a space
Example:
	i = j + x;
## Bracket position
The brackets will always be in a newline, in all cases
## Function calls
Functions calls should always look like this(note the commas and the spacing):
	int i = foo("hello", "world");
