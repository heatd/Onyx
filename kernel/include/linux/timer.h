 * timer_delete_sync - Deactivate a timer and wait for the handler to finish.
 * @timer:	The timer to be deactivated
 *
 * Synchronization rules: Callers must prevent restarting of the timer,
 * otherwise this function is meaningless. It must not be called from
 * interrupt contexts unless the timer is an irqsafe one. The caller must
 * not hold locks which would prevent completion of the timer's callback
 * function. The timer's handler must not call add_timer_on(). Upon exit
 * the timer is not queued and the handler is not running on any CPU.
 *
 * For !irqsafe timers, the caller must not hold locks that are held in
 * interrupt context. Even if the lock has nothing to do with the timer in
 * question.  Here's why::
 *
 *    CPU0                             CPU1
 *    ----                             ----
 *                                     <SOFTIRQ>
 *                                       call_timer_fn();
 *                                       base->running_timer = mytimer;
 *    spin_lock_irq(somelock);
 *                                     <IRQ>
 *                                        spin_lock(somelock);
 *    timer_delete_sync(mytimer);
 *    while (base->running_timer == mytimer);
 *
 * Now timer_delete_sync() will never return and never release somelock.
 * The interrupt on the other CPU is waiting to grab somelock but it has
 * interrupted the softirq that CPU0 is waiting to finish.
 *
 * This function cannot guarantee that the timer is not rearmed again by
 * some concurrent or preempting code, right after it dropped the base
 * lock. If there is the possibility of a concurrent rearm then the return
 * value of the function is meaningless.
 *
 * If such a guarantee is needed, e.g. for teardown situations then use
 * timer_shutdown_sync() instead.
 *
 * Return:
 * * %0	- The timer was not pending
 * * %1	- The timer was pending and deactivated

/**
 * mod_timer - Modify a timer's timeout
 * @timer:	The timer to be modified
 * @expires:	New absolute timeout in jiffies
 *
 * mod_timer(timer, expires) is equivalent to:
 *
 *     timer_delete(timer); timer->expires = expires; add_timer(timer);
 *
 * mod_timer() is more efficient than the above open coded sequence. In
 * case that the timer is inactive, the timer_delete() part is a NOP. The
 * timer is in any case activated with the new expiry time @expires.
 *
 * Note that if there are multiple unserialized concurrent users of the
 * same timer, then mod_timer() is the only safe way to modify the timeout,
 * since add_timer() cannot modify an already running timer.
 *
 * If @timer->function == NULL then the start operation is silently
 * discarded. In this case the return value is 0 and meaningless.
 *
 * Return:
 * * %0 - The timer was inactive and started or was in shutdown
 *	  state and the operation was discarded
 * * %1 - The timer was active and requeued to expire at @expires or
 *	  the timer was active and not modified because @expires did
 *	  not change the effective expiry time
