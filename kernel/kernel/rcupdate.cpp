/* Implementation of classic RCU as in OLS2001 ("Read-Copy Update"), Paul McKenney's RCU
 * dissertation and various early RCU articles on lwn
 * (https://lwn.net/Kernel/Index/#Read-copy-update).
 * Essentially, the algorithm works like this:
 * rcu_read_lock() and rcu_read_unlock() are non-preemptible sections. Context switches are
 * quiescent states. This minimizes reader overhead to a non-atomic pcpu add.
 *
 * When a writer writes to an RCU data structure, it first locks (to serialize against other
 * writers, if needed) changes (some things cannot be done willy nilly, like list removal, as
 * readers are currently traversing), and unlocks. The special sauce here is reclamation. One will
 * call call_rcu() with a destruction function and the rcu_head that was embedded in the object
 * we're reclaiming. That rcu_head will get appended to the 'next' list for the current CPU (more on
 * that later). When a CPU goes through a quiescent state, if 'next' is not empty, it attempts to
 * start a grace period. This behavior allows for batching, as many call_rcu calls can get completed
 * in one scheduler slice.
 *
 * The RCU global state consists of:
   struct rcu_ctrlblk
    {
        spinlock lock;
        1) A lock, protecting rcu_ctrlblk from concurrent changes.
        unsigned long curgen;
        2) The current gen/batch number that is being processed
        unsigned long maxgen;
        3) The maximum gen/batch number that any given CPU on the system is on.
           This is set in rcu_start_batch. If curgen > maxgen, we don't have grace periods to
           process.
        cpumask mask __align_cache;
        4) CPU mask that represents CPUs that have still not gone through a quiescent state since
           the grace period started.
    };
 *
 * Each CPU then has its own local state, rcu_pcpublk:
 *
    struct rcu_pcpublk
    {
        unsigned long gen;
        1) The gen/batch this CPU is on, set in rcu_try_batch.
        struct rcu_cblist current, next;
        2) Singly linked lists of rcu_heads for current callbacks and next callbacks.
           Current callbacks are cbs that *may* need processing right now, if we have gone through
           gen. Next callbacks are queued up in call_rcu and are moved to current when we try to
           start a batch.
    };
 * All the queiscent state code runs under softirq, as soon as possible, actioned by rcu_do_quiesc
 * (called by the scheduler) if need be.
 * To attempt to limit latency, we keep a 'onetime_processed_limit' for a
 * limit of callbacks to process at once, as softirq steals time from scheduler threads.
 * When call_rcu notices that the 'next' list is getting too long, it attempts to force a
 * queiscent state on the current thread as soon as possible.
 *
 * This RCU implementation is annotated with tracepoints you can use to collect data from userspace.
 *
 * Example of a grace period:
 * CPU0                              |                CPU1              |       CPU2
 * call_rcu()                        |                                  |

 * rcu_do_quiesc()                   |                                  |
