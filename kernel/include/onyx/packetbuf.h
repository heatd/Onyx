/**
 * @brief The packetbuf is the data structure used to transport data up and
 * down the network stack. Its design is inspired by linux's sk_buff but adapted
 * to be more versatile and easier to use from the driver's point of view, by adopting
 * a full page_iov design.
 *
 * The packetbuf consists of two areas:
 *
 * 1) The head area: This is corresponds to the first page_vec entry and is directly
 *    accessible by put() and push_header(). The headers' placement is limited by the head area.
 *
 * 2) The data area: This corresponds to the rest of the page_vec and holds any data that doesn't
 *    fit in the head area.
 *
 *
 * Future design considerations:
 * 1) Future implementations of zero copy networking may need to reserve the first iov. It is then
 *    unclear if there are going to limitations in the packet's physical fragmentation of memory.
 *
 * 2) The packetbufs don't yet account for memory. It's noteworthy that packetbufs have huge
 * internal fragmentation, since every page_iov has a single PAGE_SIZE'd page that may consume a lot
 * more memory than the actual packet's size. We should either: 1) Ignore any wastefulness(provides
 * less accurate bookkeeping) or 2) Add some kmalloc-like-thing that allocates a chunk of physically
 * contiguous memory. This would possibly require a new page allocator in an efficient
 * implementation.
 *

     * most 64KiB of space for the buffer, since that's the most we'll
     * be able to buffer in one packet, for mostly technical but also practical reasons.
     * So, we're getting 'x' number of iovs for the packet's data and 2 more;
     * 1 is used as header data, because IF we're using zero-copy networking
     * there will be inevitably a gap between the headers(which should span at most from
     * [0 ... 120's...] and the end of the page.
     * The other iov is used as a terminating canary.
